# HederaWise - Project Details

## Project Description
HederaWise is a blockchain-based savings platform built on Hedera that enables parents to create secure "nest" savings accounts for their children. These accounts automatically unlock when the child turns 18, combining traditional savings with DeFi principles. The platform features cross-platform mobile and web applications, NFT integration, and customizable savings plans, making long-term financial planning accessible and transparent through blockchain technology.

## Selected Hackathon Track
**Theme 2: DeFi & Tokenization - Basic Problem Statement (DeFi & Tokenization)**

Traditional savings accounts for children lack transparency, have low interest rates, and don't leverage modern financial technology. Parents struggle to find secure, long-term savings solutions that combine accessibility with the benefits of decentralized finance.
